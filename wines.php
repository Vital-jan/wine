        <p>The process of winemaking is one of a kind.

        Now days, the process of winemaking in Georgia uses a wide range of techniques—from the traditional Georgian method of fermenting the wine in clay Qvevri’s, to the European process using modern equipment and techniques, like stainless steel tanks and oak barrels.  Wine made today in the traditional Georgian method follows the same process Georgians have developed to make wine more than 8,000 years. The process of winemaking is one of a kind.

        <h2>Qvevri Wine phenomenon</h2>
        
        <img class='img-right' src='assets/img/kvevry.jpg'>
        <p>Traditionally, the classic way of producing Georgian wine involves the country’s signature Qvevri. The tradition of winemaking in Qvevri, a large egg-shaped clay vessel, is so tied to the culture. Before use, the Qvevri’s are carefully cleaned and then coated with beeswax. The process then involves pressing the grapes and then pouring the juice, grape skins, stalks and pips into the Qvevri, and then completely sealed to further prevent contamination and oxidation. The natural yeasts of the grapes allow fermentation without additives, and the natural tannins prevent spoilage without artificial preservatives. The vessels’ conical shape allows yeast and sediment to settle to the bottom freely while the wine is allowed to circulate within the wider center. When buried underground, Qvevri maintain the temperature of fermenting wine like modern temperature-controlled tanks do. The taste of Qvevri wines differ from barrel wines in that no oak flavor seeps into the wine.
