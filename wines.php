        <p>Georgia is a small mountainous country in the area where Europe and Asia meet. Georgia boasts more than 500 varieties of indigenous grapes—nearly one-sixth of the world’s grape varieties—including endangered vines found nowhere else on Earth. Georgian grapes are unique, indigenous that often cannot be found elsewhere.   They present both unique flavors and aromas. Acid is a lot mellower and not as aggressive. Georgia is on the same latitude as Tuscany and has similar territorial conditions perfect for wine production. The country is rich with natural springs that come from the Caucasian Mountains and flow into the valleys.  The leading wine growing regions are mountainous and thus have the combination of sunshine and the coolness that grapes need. A rich diversity of soil, climate, the angle at which the sun falls on the vineyards and the many indigenous grape varieties creates a huge variety of wine tastes and aromas. Traditionally, Georgian wines carry the name of the source region, district, or village, much like French regional wines such as Bordeaux or Burgundy. As with these French wines, Georgian wines are usually a blend of two or more grapes. There are five main regions of viniculture, the principal region being Kakheti, the most popular wine region of Georgia, which produces seventy percent of Georgia's grapes.</p>

        <h2>Qvevri Wine phenomenon</h2>

        <p>Traditionally, the classic way of producing Georgian wine involves the country’s signature Qvevri. The tradition of winemaking in Qvevri, a large egg-shaped clay vessel, is so tied to the culture. Before use, the Qvevri’s are carefully cleaned and then coated with beeswax. The process then involves pressing the grapes and then pouring the juice, grape skins, stalks and pips into the Qvevri, and then completely sealed to further prevent contamination and oxidation. The natural yeasts of the grapes allow fermentation without additives, and the natural tannins prevent spoilage without artificial preservatives. The vessels’ conical shape allows yeast and sediment to settle to the bottom freely while the wine is allowed to circulate within the wider center. When buried underground, Qvevri maintain the temperature of fermenting wine like modern temperature-controlled tanks do. The taste of Qvevri wines differ from barrel wines in that no oak flavor seeps into the wine. </p>

        <p>Now days, the process of winemaking in Georgia uses a wide range of techniques—from the traditional Georgian method of fermenting the wine in clay Qvevri’s, to the European process using modern equipment and techniques, like stainless steel tanks and oak barrels.  Wine made today in the traditional Georgian method follows the same process Georgians have developed to make wine more than 8,000 years. The process of winemaking is one of a kind.</p>
