        Nowadays, the process of winemaking in Georgia uses a wide range of techniques—from the
        traditional Georgian method of fermenting the wine in clay Qvevri’s, to the European process
        using modern equipment and techniques, like stainless steel tanks and oak barrels. Wine made
        today in the traditional Georgian method follows the same process Georgians have developed
        to make wine more than 8,000 years and this process is one of a kind.

        <h2>Qvevri Wine phenomenon</h2>

        <p>
        Traditionally, the classic way of producing Georgian wine involves the country’s signature
        Qvevri. Before use, the Qvevri’s are carefully cleaned and then coated with beeswax. The
        process then involves pressing the grapes and then pouring the juice, grape skins, stalks and
        pips into the Qvevri. Then it is completely sealed to further prevent contamination and oxidation.
        The natural yeasts of the grapes allow fermentation without additives, and the natural tannins
        prevent spoilage without artificial preservatives. The vessels’ conical shape allows yeast and
        sediment to settle to the bottom freely while the wine is allowed to circulate within the wider
        center. When buried underground, Qvevri maintain the temperature of fermenting wine like
        modern temperature-controlled tanks do. The taste of Qvevri wines differ from barrel wines in
        that no oak flavor seeps into the wine.

            Orange is the new Red
            </h2>
            <p>
            The process of making orange wine is very old, but the re-invigoration of this ancient process
has only resurfaced in the past 20 years. Many modern-day orange winemakers look as far back as 5000 years in Caucasus (modern-day country of Georgia) where wines were fermented in large subterranean vessels called Qvevri (“Kvev-ree”) that were originally closed with stones
and sealed with beeswax. Here are just a few well-known wines you should look for: Mtsvane
Qvevri, Kisi, Khikhvi, Saperavi Qvevri.
