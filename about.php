    World’s Finest Wines, LLC is an importer/wholesaler of Georgian wines. We have created our company with the aim of publicizing delicious, elegant and genuinely unique wines from the country of Georgia.  The owners first experienced Georgian wine on a trip to Kyiv in neighboring Ukraine. They fell in love with the richness and depth of taste of Kindzmarauli and Mukuzani. They were so impressed, that when they returned home to North Carolina they embarked on a mission to find these wines in local wine merchants, but were unable to find any. So they set about creating World’s Finest Wines, LLC to bring these amazing wines to North Carolina and share these amazing new wines with the American wine lovers.
