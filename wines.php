        Nowadays, the process of winemaking in Georgia uses a wide range of techniques—from the
        traditional Georgian method of fermenting the wine in clay Qvevri’s, to the European process
        using modern equipment and techniques, like stainless steel tanks and oak barrels. Wine made
        today in the traditional Georgian method follows the same process Georgians have developed
        to make wine more than 8,000 years and this process is one of a kind.

        <h2 id='qvevri'>Qvevri Wine phenomenon</h2>
        
        <p>
        Traditionally, the classic way of producing Georgian wine involves the country’s signature
        Qvevri. Before use, the Qvevri’s are carefully cleaned and then coated with beeswax. The
        process then involves pressing the grapes and then pouring the juice, grape skins, stalks and
        pips into the Qvevri. Then it is completely sealed to further prevent contamination and oxidation.
        The natural yeasts of the grapes allow fermentation without additives, and the natural tannins
        prevent spoilage without artificial preservatives. The vessels’ conical shape allows yeast and
        sediment to settle to the bottom freely while the wine is allowed to circulate within the wider
        center. When buried underground, Qvevri maintain the temperature of fermenting wine like
        modern temperature-controlled tanks do. The taste of Qvevri wines differ from barrel wines in
        that no oak flavor seeps into the wine.

        <h2>Georgian Wines</h2>
        <p>
            Georgian wine is a source of pride, pleasure, and social status. It gives people a reason to meet and take
            pleasure in each other’s company. It gives foreign wine lovers a warm welcome to Georgia and a vivid
            insight into the Georgian culture. Georgia seems inextricably intertwined with wine, and seems to be
            inviting the world to one long table, where everyone can toast each other, trying to live amicably on a
            shared planet – or terroir!
            Georgia produces a variety of wines for nearly every palate. Georgian wines are classified as sweet,
            semi-sweet, semi-dry, dry, fortified and sparkling.
            Traditionally, Georgian wines carry the name of the source region, district, or village, much like French
            regional wines such as Bordeaux or Burgundy. There are five main regions of viniculture, the principal
            region being Kakheti, the most popular wine region of Georgia, which produces seventy percent of
            Georgia&#39;s grapes. Each village in this region has its own vineyards and gives its name to their wines:
            Mukuzani, Tsynandali, Akhasheni , Tvishi etc.
            As with French wines, Georgian wines are usually a blend of two or more grapes. Some Georgian wines
            carry the name of the grapes they made of. Here are just a few well-known grapes you should know:

            <b>
                Rkatsiteli
            </b>
                is an ancient pale-skinned grape variety from the country of Georgia – one of the oldest (if not
                the oldest) wine-producing regions on earth. Thought to have been cultivated there for several
                millennia, the variety remains Georgia&#39;s most popular white-wine grape variety even today, and
                complements the most popular red-wine grape, Saperavi.

            <li>
            <b>
            Khikhvi
            </b>
                is a white grape variety. Khikhvi is relatively versatile, as it can be produced in light dry, semi-
                sweet, sweet, and, as in PDO Kardenakhi, fortified styles. Its aromatic signature is distinctive: floral notes
                of boxwood and wild flowers heighten broader flavors of ripe yellow fruits and apricot. Very
                distinguished classical (European) wines are produced from the Khikhvi grape, releasing the aroma of
                exotic plants such as box tree. High quality traditional (Qvevri) wines are also produced from Khikhvi
                grapes, imparting tones reminiscent of ripe fruit or yellow dried fruit. With moderate alcohol levels and
                soft acidity, Khikhvi may stand alone as a single varietal wine, or may contribute high-tones to enhance a
                blend. It is a grape that deserves greater attention.
            </li>

            <li>
            <b>
                Mtsvane/Mtsvane Kakhuri/Mitsvane Goruli
            </b>
                is a grape variety used to make Georgian wines. It is used to
                make white wine. It was so named to refer to the yellowish-green coloring of the ripened berries. It is
                often blended with Rkatsiteli to create a fruity, aromatic wine. In the Georgian language the word
                mtsvane means green, new, and young. Many grapes are called Mtsvane Something, and typically the
                Something part of the name has to do with where the grape is from. Mtsvane Goruli and Mtsvane
                Kakhuri are the most common. Mtsvane Goruli (or Goruli Mtsvane) means &quot;green from Gori,&quot; which is a
                town in the Kartli region in the Caucasus Mountains of south-central Georgia. Mtsvane Kakhuri means
                &quot;green from Kakheti&quot; since it is thought to be native to the Kakheti region of Georgia.

                Saperavi
            </b>
                is an acidic, teinturier-type grape variety native to the country of Georgia , where it is used to
                make many of the region&#39;s most well-known wines. Saperavi grapes produce very deep red wines (In
                Georgian Saperavi means paint, dye, give color) that are suitable for extended aging. It has the potential
                to produce high alcohol levels, and is often blended with lighter varieties. It is by far the most dominant
                Georgian red grape in terms of overall production. Wine made from Saperavi is an extractive wine with a
                characteristic bouquet, a harmonious taste, and pleasant astringency. It is known to have been in
                production since 1886.

                Aleksandrouli
            </b>
                is a Georgian red grape variety. The grape is reputed to be one of the oldest and greatest
                of the Georgian varieties. It is used to produce a semi-sweet red wine known as Khvanchkara (Joseph
                Stalin&#39;s favorite wine), or as a medium bodied, semi-dry, chewy blend. It has good acids and claimed to
                have aroma flavors reminiscent of pomegranates.

                Mujuretuli
            </b>
                is a dark-skinned Georgian grape variety, used almost exclusively in the production of
                Khvanchkara wine. Mujuretuli is usually interplant with Alexandrouli and is rarely made into varietal
                wines. When vinified separately, however, it is said to produce wines that are dark ruby in color, with
                velvety tannins and a flavor reminiscent of pomegranate.

            <b>
                Tavkveri
            </b>
                Is a red grape variety presented in the Kartli district and was once widespread across much of
                Eastern Georgia. This grape is a high-yielding and tends to ripen mid-September. Extremely versatile,
                Tavkveri can be made into sparkling, rosé, red or even sweet wines. Made by modern or traditional
                techniques, the grape produces a medium-bodied red wine with notes of cherry, earth and herbs.

            <b>
                Kisi
            </b>
                This white grape variety is mainly found in Eastern Georgia. It produces complex deep golden yellow
                wines either made the classic European way or the traditional Qvevri-fermented way. It can be said that
                Kisi has taken the middle place between two major industrial varieties of Kakheti – Mtsvane and
                Rkatsiteli. For instance, by the general appearance of the vine, particularly the shape of the leaf blade,
                Kisi is similar to Rkatsiteli, while by the coloring of berries and strong original aroma it reminds one of
                Mtsvane as well as by other characteristics. All of these give reason to consider Kisi as a natural hybrid of
                Mtsvane and Rkatsiteli. The wine made from Kisi is particularly valuable and qualitative. Kisi, together
                with Khikhvi, Chitistvala and Mtsvane, has gained great merit in high valuable wine production.            </li>
